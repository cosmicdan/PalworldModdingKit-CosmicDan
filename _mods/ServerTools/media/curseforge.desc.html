<h2>üåê About</h2><br/>
<p>Tools for your dedicated server. Highlights include SteamID whitelisting, auto-shutdown timer (with chat reminders to players), chat logging, and more - see Current Features below.</p>
<br/>
<p>Note that this mod has no function on the normal game client and supports Windows servers only (because UE4SS has not been ported to Linux yet).</p>
<br/>

<li>Player and Admin-made "shops" (trade stations) (might need a client mod if I can't do it "magic chests" style);</li>
<li>... share your ideas/requests!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>üß∞ Installation</h2><br/>
<p>Since this mod is for dedicated servers only, some intermediate knowledge is assumed. Note - do NOT use a server injector, it is not required with UE4SS v3.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If updating ServerTools</em>: delete your old <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Win64\Mods\ServerToolsLoader</span> folder first;</li>
<li><em>If installing for the first time</em>: Install <a href="https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases">UE4SS</a> 3.0 or later: Download the release, extract to <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">PalServer\Pal\Binaries\Win64\</span>and start the server once to generate the mod folders;</li>
<li>Download the Server Tools mod from CurseForge and extract. Move the contents of each folder to the correct location:<br/>
<pre>LogicMods -> PalServer\Pal\Content\Paks\LogicMods\
Mods -> PalServer\Pal\Binaries\Win64\Mods\<br/></pre>
You should end up with the files: <br/>
<pre>PalServer\Pal\Content\Paks\LogicMods\ServerTools.pak
PalServer\Pal\Binaries\Win64\Mods\ServerToolsLoader\Enabled.txt
PalServer\Pal\Binaries\Win64\Mods\ServerToolsLoader\Scripts\main.lua [with more lua files/folders] </pre><br/>
...start the server once to verify it worked and to generate default configuration files.
</li>
<li>The console/log should show some info along with the paths of the newly-generated config files; see the screenshot above for example.</li>
<li>You can now edit the configs, see the "Config Docs" below for additional details. Note that the server will need to be restarted for config to apply, *except* the whitelist config - it is read fresh from disk every time a player joins.</li>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>üìú Config Docs</h2><br/>
<em>Note that JSON is not ideal for human-editing, you must be careful to preserve commas and brackets and such. I will move to a better config format soon.</em>
<p>ServerTools.config.json:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<pre>"whitelistEnabled":true,</pre>
 - Whitelist is enabled. Be sure to add SteamID64's to the whitelist json.<br/>
<pre>"broadcastPlayerJoinLeave":true</pre>
 - If true, the server will broadcast when a player joins or leaves, in the format "Playername joined" or "Playername left".<br/>
<pre>"welcomeMsgEnabled":true,</pre>
 - Enable the welcome message below. Sent to players a few seconds after spawning.<br/>
<pre>"welcomeMsg":"Welcome to my Palworld server!",</pre>
 - Self-explainatory.<br/>
<pre>"chatLogEnabled":true</pre>
 - If true, all chat messages including slash commands will be logged to the server console / UE4SS log. Includes channel and player name.<br/>
</p></div>
<br/>
<p>ServerTools.whitelist.json</p>
<div class="spoiler"><p>
<pre>{"whitelistSteamIds":["0","1"]}</pre>
 - SteamID64's to allow. Note that the defaults of 0 and 1 are invalid and will simply be skipped; they're just for example to show the array structure (remember those darn commas).<br/>
<br/>
Note that you can edit this file while the server is running; it will be reloaded whenever a player logs in.<br/>
<br/>
Also note that you can reformat the config to make it easier to see or generate/edit via automation; ServerTools will not wreck the formatting. E.g.:<br/>
<pre>
{"whitelistSteamIds":[
    "0",
    "1",
    "12345678"
]}</pre><br/>
</p></div>
<br/>
<p>ServerTools.autoshutdown.json</p>
<div class="spoiler"><p>
<pre>"autoShutdownEnabled":false,</pre>
 - If auto shutdown is enabled. It's up to your launch script/panel/whatever to restart the server.<br/>
<pre>"shutdownAfterMinutes":60,</pre>
 - How many minutes after server launch before the shutdown will occur.
<pre>"warnAtMinutesDesc":[30,10,5,1],</pre>
 - Will broadcast a message (see below) when the server time remaining reaches these thresholds. Be sure to make sure the values are descending and there are no duplicates.<br/>
<pre>"warnMessage":"Server will restart in {1} minutes",</pre>
 - The warn message to use. {1} will be replaced with the minutes value.<br/>
<pre>"addRemainingTimeToWelcomeMsg":true,</pre>
 - If true, newly joining players will be notified of the next restart time in minutes. Requires welcome message to be enabled.<br/>
<pre>"addRemainingTimeMsg":"Next server restart in {1} minutes"</pre>
 - The message to add to welcome message, if enabled. {1} will be replaced with the calculated minutes remaining (rounded down so could potentially say 0 if less than 1 minute remains).<br/>
</p></div>
